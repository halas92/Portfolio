<p class="summary">When the COVID-19 pandemic prompted mass shutdowns and unemployment last spring, policymakers scrambled to keep constituents safe during the virus. One provision in the federal CARES Act established a nationwide, 120-day eviction moratorium for rental properties with federally backed mortgages. But as federal protections for renters lapsed later in the year, state and local jurisdictions also began implementing measures to keep renters housed during the pandemic.<br><br>
Maryland joins a growing number of states with codified tenant protections, and will establish a program granting low-income tenants access to counsel in eviction proceedings under a bill that became law May 30. After Washington Gov. Jay Inslee signed off on a modified version of a similar bill in April, Maryland became the second state to enact a tenants' counsel bill. On June 10, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont signed the nation's third statewide right to counsel bill after it was passed by his state's General Assembly.<br><br></p>

<p class="summary">SANTA TECLA, El Salvador – Critics of President Nayib Bukele aren't surprised by his allied lawmakers' May 1 vote to remove top judges from the country's highest court, which has drawn criticism at home and abroad. Observers have long warned about the possibility of the young president using authoritarian tactics to govern if his party won a majority in the legislature.<br><br>
"The administration, from the (chief) executive to ministers to high-ranking officials, with respect to the state of legal rights … hasn't ceased to place us on a bit of alert, and perhaps raise wariness in some sectors," Leonardo Ramírez Murcia, the president magistrate of El Salvador's Criminal Supreme Court, told U.S. News in April.<br><br></p>

<p class="summary">Activists across Maryland have spent months pressuring lawmakers in Annapolis to enact a series of immigration reform bills before the General Assembly’s session ended on Monday. With hours left in the session, they secured two decisive legislative wins.<br><br>
Before the legislature adjourned at midnight Tuesday, lawmakers passed HB23, which prohibits federal agencies from accessing noncitizens’ driving records without a warrant, and HB16, which prevents Immigration and Customs Enforcement from housing immigrants awaiting deportation in Maryland prisons. (Both passed by slim margins, with several Democrats voting against the measures).<br><br></p>

<p class="summary">As COVID-19 vaccines become more widely available, international economists say the world's 20 largest economies are in a strong position this year to recover from the pandemic's fallout.<br><br>
In 2019, the United States and China, the world's two largest economies, recorded $21 trillion and $14 trillion in gross domestic product, respectively, according to data from the International Monetary Fund. Yet with the exception of China and Switzerland, the remaining countries among the 20 largest economies experienced negative growth in their GDPs in 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic imposed lockdowns around the world.<br><br></p>

<p class="summary">When Los Angeles County's new district attorney, George Gascón, was sworn in Dec. 7, 2020, he immediately announced that his office would no longer seek cash bail for defendants charged with misdemeanors and non-serious, non-violent offenses.<br><br>
"I think eliminating money bail is one of the moral imperatives of our generation," he told U.S. News. "The money in your bank account should never determine your freedom."<br><br>
Gascón's district, which covers all 10 million residents of Los Angeles County – the country's most populous – will soon join a growing number of cities and states that have sought to largely eliminate cash bail programs for defendants.<br><br></p>

<p class="summary">Since the coronavirus pandemic first hit U.S. shores in early 2020, school systems throughout the nation have had to make transitions to digital instruction. Without a national mandate on in-person versus remote learning, school districts have been making independent decisions on education formats, often tied to the number of local coronavirus cases.<br><br>
Schools in Chattanooga and surrounding Hamilton County, Tennessee, may face less pressure to reopen physically, however. As the pandemic took off and a national lockdown set in, leaders in the public and private sectors collaborated on a network that would allow students from economically challenged households within the Hamilton County Schools district to access free high-speed Wi-Fi.<br><br></p>

<p class="summary">Sharp political polarization. Public distrust of government institutions. A refusal by supporters of a losing candidate to believe election results.<br><br>
This may describe the United States today, but it also expresses where Mexico was 30 years ago. And the steps that America's immediate neighbor to the south took to restore public confidence in elections may offer a blueprint for how the U.S. can strengthen democratic institutions that political experts say have been under attack for decades.<br><br>
International political analysts say the experiences of various countries show contrasting paths – for better or for worse – the American experiment in democracy can travel.</p>

<p class="summary">On Nov. 8, 2016, President Donald Trump won an upset victory that blindsided reporters, pundits and much of the American electorate.<br><br>
Overwhelmingly, election forecasts got it wrong. From mid-October to just before Election Day, FiveThirtyEight, the Cook Political Report, and Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball all portended a Clinton victory. But one model – American University professor Allan Lichtman's 13 Keys – correctly anticipated a Trump win.<br><br>
And this time, Lichtman said seven keys are turned against Trump, which means he will lose the White House.</p>

<p class="summary">SUDLERSVILLE, Maryland – When residents of the Town of Sudlersville joined a virtual commissioner’s meeting at 6:30 p.m. last Wednesday, they could see Town Commission President Ron Ford in a mask and gloves seated next to Commissioner Charles Leager — also masked — at a long, deep brown table. Besides two other commissioners and the town lawyer and clerk, the town hall was empty.<br><br>
Located about 50 miles east of Annapolis in Queen Anne’s County, Sudlersville had a population just below 500 as of the 2010 census. Perhaps its biggest claim to fame is being the birthplace of 1930s Hall of Fame baseball player Jimmie Foxx.</p>

Hill said she realized she had been cut out of diplomatic discussions because, while she was engaged in national security matters, Gordon Sondland, American ambassador to the European Union, was on a “domestic political errand” in Ukraine on behalf of Trump.</p>

<p class="summary">WASHINGTON - Carried by Armed Forces body bearers, the late Rep.

<p class="summary">WASHINGTON - A languid rain fell outside the U.S. Supreme Court Oct. 16 as Virginia Solicitor General Toby Heytens rose from the petitioner’s bench. The courtroom’s stillness echoed beneath a frieze high on the south wall depicting ancient lawgivers like Hammurabi and Augustus.
<br><br>
Heytens—a plump man with a bald crown and graying brown hair—argued Virginia’s position for upholding a convicted sniper’s four juvenile life sentences without parole before the highest court in the land.
