<p class="summary">WASHINGTON - Carried by Armed Forces body bearers, the late Rep. Elijah Cummings’s flag-draped casket ascended the steps of the United States Capitol Thursday morning and was placed on a catafalque in National Statuary Hall, where he became the first black elected official to lie in state there.
<br><br>
Maya Rockeymoore Cummings stood at the entrance as the soldiers, sailors and Marines brought her husband’s body into the historic former House chamber where Abraham Lincoln once served. Her right hand covered her heart as she struggled to hold back tears.</p>

<p class="summary">WASHINGTON - A languid rain fell outside the U.S. Supreme Court Oct. 16 as Virginia Solicitor General Toby Heytens rose from the petitioner’s bench. The courtroom’s stillness echoed beneath a frieze high on the south wall depicting ancient lawgivers like Hammurabi and Augustus.
<br><br>
Heytens—a plump man with a bald crown and graying brown hair—argued Virginia’s position for upholding a convicted sniper’s four juvenile life sentences without parole before the highest court in the land.

<p class="summary">WASHINGTON – Rep. Elijah Cummings, a veteran Democratic congressman who represented Baltimore and served as a key figure in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, died Thursday due to “long-standing health problems,” his office said. He was 68.
<br><br>
Cummings spent decades advocating for civil rights in Baltimore and represented Maryland’s 7th Congressional district since 1996. He had previously served 13 years as a delegate in the Maryland State House. A spokeswoman said he died at Gilchrist Hospice Care in Baltimore at 2:45 am.</p>
