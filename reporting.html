<p class="summary">Sharp political polarization. Public distrust of government institutions. A refusal by supporters of a losing candidate to believe election results.<br><br>
This may describe the United States today, but it also expresses where Mexico was 30 years ago. And the steps that America's immediate neighbor to the south took to restore public confidence in elections may offer a blueprint for how the U.S. can strengthen democratic institutions that political experts say have been under attack for decades.<br><br>
International political analysts say the experiences of various countries show contrasting paths – for better or for worse – the American experiment in democracy can travel.</p>

<p class="summary">On Nov. 8, 2016, President Donald Trump won an upset victory that blindsided reporters, pundits and much of the American electorate.<br><br>
Overwhelmingly, election forecasts got it wrong. From mid-October to just before Election Day, FiveThirtyEight, the Cook Political Report, and Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball all portended a Clinton victory. But one model – American University professor Allan Lichtman's 13 Keys – correctly anticipated a Trump win.<br><br>
And this time, Lichtman said seven keys are turned against Trump, which means he will lose the White House.</p>

<p class="summary">SUDLERSVILLE, Maryland – When residents of the Town of Sudlersville joined a virtual commissioner’s meeting at 6:30 p.m. last Wednesday, they could see Town Commission President Ron Ford in a mask and gloves seated next to Commissioner Charles Leager — also masked — at a long, deep brown table. Besides two other commissioners and the town lawyer and clerk, the town hall was empty.<br><br>
Located about 50 miles east of Annapolis in Queen Anne’s County, Sudlersville had a population just below 500 as of the 2010 census. Perhaps its biggest claim to fame is being the birthplace of 1930s Hall of Fame baseball player Jimmie Foxx.</p>

“Do you believe in investing hundreds of millions of city dollars in maintaining the Jones Falls Expressway? Or are you ready to build a coalition to tear it down?” asked Lisa Snowden-McCray at a transportation-themed forum for mayoral candidates held at The Real News Network headquarters.</p>

<p class="summary">WASHINGTON – Former National Security Council Russia expert Fiona Hill and diplomat David Holmes testified in what may be the final public impeachment hearing Thursday, reinforcing previous witnesses’ assertions that President Donald Trump directly linked a White House meeting and military aid to Ukrainian investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and the 2016 election.<br><br>
Hill said she realized she had been cut out of diplomatic discussions because, while she was engaged in national security matters, Gordon Sondland, American ambassador to the European Union, was on a “domestic political errand” in Ukraine on behalf of Trump.</p>

The House passed a resolution by a 232-196 vote – almost entirely along party lines – that calls for public hearings, the release of transcripts from closed-door proceedings and outlines the participation of Republican members of Congress, Trump’s lawyers and Trump himself.</p>

Heytens—a plump man with a bald crown and graying brown hair—argued Virginia’s position for upholding a convicted sniper’s four juvenile life sentences without parole before the highest court in the land.

<br><br>
Cummings spent decades advocating for civil rights in Baltimore and represented Maryland’s 7th Congressional district since 1996. He had previously served 13 years as a delegate in the Maryland State House. A spokeswoman said he died at Gilchrist Hospice Care in Baltimore at 2:45 am.</p>
