The virus has caused 120,914 deaths globally, and killed 23,649 Americans.

Hogan <a href="https://wtop.com/coronavirus/2020/03/coronavirus-update-latest-developments-in-maryland-dc-and-virginia/" class="graph-link">announced</a> March 20 that a Baltimore County man in his 60s was the state's second confirmed COVID-19 death. Late March 21, a Montgomery County woman in her 40s with an underlying medical condition was declared the state's <a href="https://bethesdamagazine.com/bethesda-beat/coronavirus/first-montgomery-county-resident-dies-of-coronavirus-disease/" class="graph-link">third coronavirus fatality</a>.<br><br>
The state's Washington suburbs have borne the brunt of the coronavirus outbreak thus far, with Montgomery&mdash;where roughly <a href="https://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/01glance/html/pop.html#county" class="graph-link">one sixth of the state's 6 million residents</a> live&mdash;and Prince George's Counties leading the tally for confirmed cases.<br><br>
Hogan enacted <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2020/03/13/schools-closing-for-2-weeks-as-officials-announce-extraordinary-measures-to-combat-virus/" class="graph-link">a sweeping executive order</a> March 12 that would close public schools statewide, prohibit public gatherings of more than 250 people, close the cruise ship terminal at the Port of Baltimore, and direct "non-essential" state employees to work from home, among other measures. He recommended that private sector employees work from home when possible.<br><br>
Hogan <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/03/19/umd-coronavirus-class-online-spring-semester-end-hogan-maryland-usm/" class="graph-link">advised</a> March 19 that the University System of Maryland's Board of Regents switch public colleges and universities to online instruction for the remainder of their semesters. University of Maryland President Wallace Loh <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/03/19/umd-usm-graduation-cancelled-online-classes-undergraduates-coronavirus-covid19-maryland-college-park/" class="graph-link">announced later that day</a> that the school would hold classes online for the rest of the semester and cancelled in-person spring commencement ceremonies.<br><br>
Schools throughout Maryland are now expected to be closed through <a href="https://bethesdamagazine.com/bethesda-beat/coronavirus/maryland-schools-to-stay-closed-through-april-24/" class="graph-link">at least April 24</a>.

<p class="summary">In the first days of the coronavirus' presence in Maryland, President Donald Trump downplayed the risks it posed. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1237027356314869761" class="graph-link">March 9 tweet</a>, he wrote, "So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu... Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!"<br><br>
And despite swiftly declaring a state of emergency when Maryland's first cases were reported, Hogan initially tried to maintain a veneer of normalcy. "Marylanders should go to work or go to school as they normally do," he <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs-hs-coronavirus-wrap-up-20200306-ipbh7t5r4zhxpidx3kgeiq3seu-story.html" class="graph-link">said March 5</a>.</p><br><br>

On March 16, Hogan issued <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs-md-hogan-coronavirus-actions-20200316-lnp646cuxnbbxo4ftha6tmvo4m-story.html?15843718770563#icb-arc-story-id" class="graph-link">a new executive order</a> that would force bars, restaurants, movie theaters and gyms to close indefinitely, beginning at 5 p.m. that day.

<p class="summary">As residents were increasingly encouraged to hunker down at home, industries throughout the state began <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2020/03/19/mgm-national-harbor-lays-off-employees-amid.html" class="graph-link">laying off staff</a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/19/unemployment-insurance-today-coronavirus/" class="graph-link">unemployment claims</a> started to soar.
On March 19, as a 5-year-old Howard County girl became the state's <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs-md-hogan-coronavirus-update-20200319-r5uitksji5cojfxph2mqfk7fdi-story.html" class="graph-link">first child to test positive</a> for the coronavirus, Hogan issued a new executive order limiting the size of social getherings to no more than 10 people and directing the closure of shopping malls and amusement parks.<br><br>
"Let me be very clear," Hogan said at a news conference in Annapolis that day. "If you are engaged in this type of activity [large social gatherings], you are in violation of state law and you are endangering the lives of your fellow Marylanders."<br><br>
Prior to adjourning three weeks ahead of schedule, the General Assembly passed a <a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/SB1080?ys=2020RS" class="graph-link">bill</a> extending unemployment benefits to individuals under quarantine or whose employers have been forced to close during the coronavirus outbreak, amid a host of <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2020/03/19/frenzied-lawmaking-and-tender-moments-in-tense-sessions-final-hours/" class="graph-link">rapid-fire legislation</a>.<br><br>
Hogan <a href="https://governor.maryland.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Gatherings-THIRD-AMENDED-3.23.20.pdf" class="graph-link">amended and expanded</a> his March 19 executive order March 23, directing all non-essential businesses&mdash;according to the Department of Homeland Security's <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_Guidance_on_the_Essential_Critical_Infrastructure_Workforce_508C_0.pdf" class="graph-link">critical infrastructure workforce guidelines</a>&mdash;to close at 5 p.m. Restaurants were still able to fill carry out and delivery orders, and grocery stores, pharmacies, banks, and liquor stores were permitted to remain open.<br><br>
He also announced an <a href="https://governor.maryland.gov/2020/03/23/governor-hogan-announces-closure-of-all-non-essential-businesses-175-million-relief-package-for-workers-and-small-businesses-affected-by-covid-19/" class="graph-link">aid package</a> of more than $175 million for businesses and workers adversely affected by the coronavirus. Highlights include a $75 million loan and $50 million grant fund for businesses, as well as a $7 million Layoff Aversion Fund that would allow employers to invest in telework equipment and sanitation services for essential workplaces.<br><br>
Hogan issued a <a href="https://governor.maryland.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Gatherings-FOURTH-AMENDED-3.30.20.pdf" class="graph-link">stay-at-home order</a> effective March 30 at 8 p.m. The directive built on his preceding executive orders on social distancing, this time imposing up to one year of imprisonment or a $5,000 fine&mdash;or both&mdash;for individuals found outside their homes for non-essential purposes.<br><br>
Maryland officials have confirmed 302 deaths linked to COVID-19 as of April 14 at 10 a.m. The state also began reporting figures for confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths by race that day, which show African-Americans affected by the disease at higher rates than other racial groups.</p><br><br>
